                        China first began to develop its formal writing system during this dynasty. 
                        People carved pictographic characters onto bones and shells. These are called 'oracle bone' characters. 
                        From the inscriptions on tortoise shells it is inferred that people of the Shang Dynasty used 
                        calendars and developed knowledge of astronomy and math.

                        a narrow ankle-length skirt. They then wore a peice of cloth that hung down

                        this dynasty was too short to make any changes to fashion. Emperor Qin was not
                        around long enough to completely unify Chinese fashion but he unified color. 
                        He chose black as the uniform color of fashion because black represented the power of 
                        water and the Zhou dynasty's favored color was red, the symbol of fire. Water extiguishes
                        fire.
